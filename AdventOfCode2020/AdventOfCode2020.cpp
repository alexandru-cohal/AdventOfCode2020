// - This file contains the 'main' function
// - Program execution begins and ends here
// - For running the solution of a specific puzzle from a specific day, you have to:
//      - Change the header file (e.g. #include "day3/day3puzzle2.h")
//      - Change the function called from the 'main' function (e.g. mainDay3Puzzle2();)

#include "day16/day16puzzle2.h"
